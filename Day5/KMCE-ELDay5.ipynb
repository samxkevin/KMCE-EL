    "###### __Additional Information__:\n",
    "1. **`sklearn dataset, shuffle=True`**:\n",
    "   In scikit-learn, when loading a dataset (e.g., `load_iris()`), the parameter `shuffle=True` ensures the data is shuffled randomly before splitting into training and testing sets. This helps avoid bias in model training by ensuring data points are randomly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`torch.manual_seed()`**:\n",
    "   `torch.manual_seed()` is used in PyTorch to set the random seed for generating random numbers. By setting a specific seed value, it ensures reproducibility of experiments, meaning that the same results can be obtained when running the code multiple times, provided other factors remain unchanged."
